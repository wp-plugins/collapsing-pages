Stable tag: 0.6.1

This plugin uses Javascript to dynamically expand or collapsable the set of
pages for each parent page.

== Description ==

This is a very simple plugin that uses Javascript to form a collapsable set of
links in the sidebar for the pages. Every page corresponding to a given
parent page will be expanded.

It is largely based off of my Collapsing Pages and Collapsing Archives
plugins. 

= What's new?=

* 0.6.1 (2010.06.21)
    * Removed extraneous debugging info (subpagecount=)

* 0.6 (2010.06.18)
    * Fixed html validation bug when linkToPage is false (thanks to
      levente.csabai)
    * fixed html parsing error in widget (thanks to vbonline)'


== Installation ==

IMPORTANT!
Please deactivate before upgrading, then re-activate the plugin. 

MANUAL INSTALLATION
(the only option for pre 2.3 wordpress, unless you have the widget plugin installed)

Unpackage contents to wp-content/plugins/ so that the files are in
a collapsPage directory. Now enable the plugin. To use the plugin,
change the following where appropriate	(most likely sidebar.php):

	<ul>
	 `<?php wp_list_pages(...); ?>`
	</ul>

To something of the following:
`
	<?php
  echo "<ul>\n";
	  if( function_exists('collapsPage') ) {
	  collapsPage();
	} else {
	  wp_list_pages(...);
	}
  echo "</ul>\n";
	?>
`
You can specify options if you wish. See the options section.

The above will fall back to the WP function for pages if you disable
the plugin.

WIDGET INSTALLATION

For those who have widget capabilities, (default in Wordpress 2.3+), installation is easier. 

Unzip contents to wp-content/plugins/ so that the files are in a
collapsing-pages directory.  You must enable the Collapsing Pages plugin,  then
simply go the Presentation > Widgets section and add the Collapsing Pages
Widget.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=  How do I change the style of the collapsing categories lists? =

As of version 0.5.3, there are several default styles that come with
collapsing-categories. You can choose from these in the settings panel, or you
can create your own custom style. A good strategy is to choose a default, then
modify it slightly to your needs. 

The following classes are used:
* collapsing - applied to all ul and li elements
* pages - applied to all ul and li elements
* list - applied to the top-level ul
* item - applied to each li which has no sub-elements
* expand - applied to a page which can be expanded (is currently
  collapsed)
* collapse - applied to a page which can be collapsed (is currently
  expanded)
* sym - class for the expanding / collapsing symbol

An example:
`
<ul id='widget-collapspage-3-collapsPageList' class='collapsing pages list'>
  <li id='about-nav' class='collapsing pages item'><a href='http://blog.robfelty.com/about/' title="About">About</a>
  </li>
<li id='donate-nav' class='collapsing pages item'><a
href='http://blog.robfelty.com/donate/' title="Donate">Donate</a>
</li> <!-- ending page subcat count = 0-->
<li class='collapsing pages '><span title="Click to collapse"
class='collapsing pages collapse' onclick='expandCollapse(event, "▶", "▼", 1,
"collapsing pages"); return false'><span class='sym'>▼</span></span><a

</ul>
`

= How do I make the current page prominent in the list of pages? =

The current page has the "self" class. By default, the "self" class style is
set to bold. If you would like to change this, you can change it in the
settings page.


== Screenshots ==

1. a few expanded pages with default theme, showing nested pages
2. a few expanded pages with default theme, showing drop down version 

== Options ==
If using the manual version, you can pass options either as an array, or using
the query style, just like for other wordpress functions such as
`wp_list_pages`
`
  $defaults=array(
    'title' => __('Pages', 'collapsing-pages'), 
    'sortOrder'=> 'ASC' ,
    'sort'=> 'pageName' ,
    'defaultExpand'=> '',
    'expand' => 0,
    'depth' =>-1,
    'inExcludePage' => 'exclude',
    'linkToPage' => true,
    'inExcludePages' => '',
    'showPosts' => false,
    'animate' => 0,
    'useCookies' => true,
    'postTitleLength' => 0
    'debug' => false,
  );
`
* inExcludePage
    * Whether to include or exclude certain pages 
        * 'exclude' (default) 
        * 'include'
* inExcludePages
    * The pages which should be included or excluded
* showPosts
    * Whether or not to include posts as well as pages. Default if false
* linkToPage
    * True, clicking on a parent page title will link to that page (default)
    * False, clicking on a parent page will expand to show sub-pages
* sort
    * How to sort the pages. Possible values:
        * 'pageName' the title of the page (default)
        * 'pageId' the Id of the page
        * 'pageSlug' the url of the page
        * 'menuOrder' custom order specified in the pages settings
* sortOrder
    * Whether pages should be sorted in normal or reverse
      order. Possible values:
        * 'ASC' normal order (a-z 0-9) (default)
        * 'DESC' reverse order (z-a 9-0)  
* expand
    * The symbols to be used to mark expanding and collapsing. Possible values:
        * '0' Triangles (default)
        * '1' + -
        * '2' [+] [-]
        * '3' images (you can upload your own if you wish)
        * '4' custom symbols
* customExpand
    * If you have selected '4' for the expand option, this character will be
      used to mark expandable link categories
* customCollapse
    * If you have selected '4' for the expand option, this character will be
      used to mark collapsible link categories
* postTitleLength
    * Truncate post titles to this number of characters (default: 0 = don't
      truncate)
* animate
    * When set to true, collapsing and expanding will be animated
*   useCookies
    * When true, expanding and collapsing of pages is remembered for each
      visitor. When false, pages are always display collapsed (unless
      explicitly set to auto-expand). Possible values:
         * true (default)
         * false
* debug
    * When set to true, extra debugging information will be displayed in the
      underlying code of your page (but not visible from the browser). Use
      this option if you are having problems

= Examples =

`collapsPage('animate=true&sort=ASC&expand=3,inExcludePages=about')`
This will produce a list with:
* animation on
* shown in alphabetical order
* using images to mark collapsing and expanding
* exclude page about
== Demo ==

I use this plugin in my blog at http://blog.robfelty.com


== CAVEAT ==

Currently this plugin relies on Javascript to expand and collapse the links.
If a user's browser doesn't support javascript they won't see the links to the
posts, but the links to the pages will still work (which is the default
behavior in wordpress anyways)
